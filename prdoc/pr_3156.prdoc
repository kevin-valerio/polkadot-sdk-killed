title: Make the core-fellowship work with swapped members

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      The ranked-collective pallet got the ability to swap members but the core-fellowship pallet
      would not be notified of this change. This MR adds `MemberSwappedHandler` to the collective
      that is implemented by the fellowship.
